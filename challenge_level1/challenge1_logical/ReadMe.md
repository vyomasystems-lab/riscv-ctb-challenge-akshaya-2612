BUG 1:  Illegal Operands 
* The register z4 is not defined in RISC-V ISA. Therefore, it's invalid.
* It is fixed by replacing z4 with s4 because s4 is defined in the RISC-V ISA.

BUG 2: Illegal Operands
* The andi (and immediate) instruction requires the third operand to be an immediate value.
* Here, the third operand is a register (s0) which is not immediate. Therefore, it's invalid.
* It is fixed by replacing s0 by an immediate value 3
